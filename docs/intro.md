# Applied Quantum Mechanics - MATLAB Programs

Welcome to the interactive documentation for the MATLAB programs from **Applied Quantum Mechanics** by A.F.J. Levi.

## About This Collection

This documentation provides easy access to all MATLAB programs included with the book. Each program is organized by chapter and includes:

- 📊 **Full source code** with syntax highlighting
- 📥 **Download links** for all files
- 📖 **Chapter context** and program descriptions

## How to Use

1. **Browse Programs**: Use the sidebar to navigate through programs organized by chapter
2. **View Code**: Each program page displays the complete MATLAB source code
3. **Download**: Download any program directly to run on your local MATLAB installation

## System Requirements

From the original README:
- IBM or 100% compatible system with Intel 486, Pentium, or equivalent
- 8-bit or better graphics adapter and display
- Minimum 32 MB RAM
- At least 50 MB disk space
- Windows 95, NT4, Windows 2000, or Windows XP (or later)
- MATLAB installed

## Getting Started

To run these programs:
1. Download the `.m` file from any program page
2. Open MATLAB
3. Set the MATLAB path to the directory containing the downloaded file
4. Type the filename (without `.m` extension) in the MATLAB command window
5. Press Enter to execute

Some programs will prompt for keyboard input, and most display results graphically with intermediate results in the MATLAB command window.

## Utility Functions

Several programs use these utility functions:
- [`chempot.m`](/utilities/chempot.m) - Chemical potential calculations
- [`fermi.m`](/utilities/fermi.m) - Fermi distribution
- [`mu.m`](/utilities/mu.m) - Mu function
- [`runge4.m`](/utilities/runge4.m) - 4th order Runge-Kutta integration
- [`Solve_schM.m`](/utilities/Solve_schM.m) - Schrödinger equation solver

Additionally, `Chapt9Exercise5.m` reads data from [`datainLI.txt`](/utilities/datainLI.txt).

## About the Book

**Applied Quantum Mechanics** by A.F.J. Levi provides practical approaches to quantum mechanics concepts with hands-on MATLAB implementations.

*Note: These programs are written in a simple, straightforward manner to minimize confusion and serve as an aid to studying applied quantum mechanics. Integration is performed explicitly when required, and special MATLAB functions are used for matrix diagonalization exercises.*
