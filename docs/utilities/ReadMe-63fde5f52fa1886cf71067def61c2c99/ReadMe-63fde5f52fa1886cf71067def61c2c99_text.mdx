AppliedQMmatlabThe computer requirements for the MATLAB language arean IBM or 100% compatible system equipped with Intel486, Pentium, Pentium Pro, Pentium4 processor orequivalent.  A CD-ROM drive is required for softwareinstallation.  There should be a 8-bit or bettergraphics adapter and display, a minimum of 32 MB RAM,and at least 50 MB disk space.  The operating systemshould be Windows95, NT4, Windows2000, or WindowsXP.________________________________________________________If you have not already installed MATLAB, please do soby purchasing a copy of the MATLAB program and followingthe installation instructions.________________________________________________________After verifying correct installation of the MATLAB application program insert the CD_ROM that came with yourcopy of the book Applied Quantum Mechanics into yourcomputer's CD-ROM drive.  Copy the directory AppliedQMmatlab on the CD-ROM to a convenient location in your computeruser directory.________________________________________________________Launch the MATLAB application program using the iconon the desktop or from the start menu.  The MATLABcommand window will appear in your computer screen.From the MATLAB command window use the path browserto set the path to the location of the AppliedQMmatlabdirectory.  Type the name of the file you with toexecute in the MATLAB command window (do not includethe '.m' extension).  Press the enter key on thekeyboard to run the program.You will find that some programs prompt for inputfrom the keyboard.  Most programs display resultsgraphically with intermediate results displayed inthe MATLAB command window.To edit values in a program or to edit the programitself double click on the file name to open the fileeditor. ________________________________________________________ Note:The computer programs in this directory are not optimized.They are written in a very simple way to minimize anypossible confusion or sources of error.  The intent isthat these programs be used as an aid to the study ofapplied quantum mechanics.When required,integration is performed explicitly, and inthe simplest way possible.  However, for exercisesinvolving matrix diagonalization use is made of specialmatlab functions.Some programs make use of the functionschempot.mfermi.mmu.mrunge4.msolve_schM.m  and Chapt9Exercise5.m reads data from the datainLI.txtdata input file._________________________________________________________
